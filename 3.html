                Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947,the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife, Aurelia (n√©e Jadrny). Schwarzenegger's father was the local chief of police. After the Anschluss in 1938, he joined the Nazi Party and, in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). 
                In World War II, he served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the rank of Hauptfeldwebel.
                He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served "in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role."
                Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected governor.
                Gustav Schwarzenegger married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared."
                He grew up in a Catholic family. Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.His favoritism was "strong and blatant", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.
                Schwarzenegger has said that his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems".Schwarzenegger has said that his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems".

                    Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.
                    For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. 
                    The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.
                    Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.
                    One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.
                    He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.
                    Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.
